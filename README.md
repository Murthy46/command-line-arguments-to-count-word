## AIM:
To write a python program for getting the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
Create a text file in a specific loaction of interest.

### Step 2: 
On the same location as the text file, create a python program file.
 
### Step 3:
In python Program, import sys and open a text file with argument "sys.argv[1]"

### Step 4: 
using read() and split(), split the lines in the file into a sequence of words

### Step 5: 
using len() count the number of words in the text file.

### Step 6:
In command prompt, initiate python followed by program name and text file name to get the output.
